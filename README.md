This is my collection of website projects I'm running through Github Pages. I have a bunch of ideas and hope this to be the literal representation of them.

This was our project for QHacks 2022 Interconnected.
The idea is a website containing canvas that updates for everyone's input on the website.
Create Art and Pictures with a community. Logic based on r/Place.
Implemented p5 library for canvas.
